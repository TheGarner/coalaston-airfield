# Coal Aston Airfield

Coal Aston Airfield is located in Derbyshire (United Kingdom). This freeware airfield is for Microsoft Flight Simulator.

Use the ICAO code EGCA to locate the airport within Flight Simulator. 

**Important Note**: As of 27/08/2020 there is an error within the simulator that makes this airfield have two ICAO codes. According to wikipedia the correct ICAO code is: EGCA but EGDF will also allow you to spawn at this field. Due to this, I have included 2x ZIP files, as I had a problem with airport vehicles spawning when using the correct ICAO when building the package. Putting both inside your "Community" folder will make sure the airport vehicles do not spawn as they did not fit in with the type of airfield this is.

# Installation Steps
Unzip the folder "CoalAstonAirfieldV1.zip" and then unzip the following folders: "thegarner-airport-egdf-coalaston.zip" into your Microsoft Flight Simulator installation directory under the "Community" folder.

# Features

I took a bit of a creative licence with this airfield and added features that may not be there in real life but makes the airfield feel a bit alive but tried to keep it realistic.

* Runways added including number markings (The numbers do not exist in real life but thought it would make it easier to identify) 
* Multiple GA parking spots
* Multiple static aircraft
* Multiple static objects such as buildings, cars, fences and more.
* 2x Light posts added around main hangar building, 2x Street lamps next to road
* Windsocks
